* **Applied Visuals**: card, funnel chart, heat map, matrix, line and column chart, bar chart 

* **Key Insights**:
  * RACHEL was mentioned the most in both episodes summary and titles -> *Indicating the whole series mostly cover stories about Rachel*
  * "THE LAST ONE PART 2" is the top 1 episode by both ratings and votes -> *Indicating this is the most favorite episode by the audience*

* **What could be improved ?**: 

  Other aspects of the dataset can still be deep dived into, e.g:
  * The relationship between CHARACTER APPEARANCES and episodes RATING/VOTES 
  * The relationship between EPISODES THEMES and episodes RATING/VOTES
  * The relationship between CHARACTER CHEMISTRY and episodes RATING/VOTES
